Here we can update each other on what each file contains (a brief summary) to make it easier to find the appropriate notebook.

**Notebooks:**
- The imputed farms are in `imputed_farm.txt`. This contains all the attributes for the 85,112 farms. This includes: location, cow, ruminant, water, grazing, milk, equipment and FMD status.
- Imputations were made using KNN (which can be unreliable for high N). This is `farm_imputation_code.ipynb` notebook. **maybe we should look into this**
